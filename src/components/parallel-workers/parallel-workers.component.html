        <p>
            Javascript is a single-threaded language, meaning it can only execute a single thing at any given time.
            However, with evolving multi-core processors it was only a matter of time before Javascript got some sort of
            parallel ability.
            Web workers are a way to spawn more threads of execution than the main thread.
            This page uses web workers to multiply lots of 10x10 matrices together.
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin execution, specify the number of concurrent threads to spawn and the number of multiplications to
            execute.
            When ready, click the "Run Parallel Count" button to create the workers and multiply the matrices.
            When the workers are finished processing all the matrices a new row in the table will appear detailing the
            time that job took.
